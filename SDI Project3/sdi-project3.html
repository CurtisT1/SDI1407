<p>My theme is a short little story I make up its about a warlock fighting three ice witch there are four characters in it. In my story there are conditional, some arrays and while loops conditional and more functions, and json data.This week i twist my story a bit to fit the assignment criteria for this week.</p>
<p>The twist i put on the story is i added more characters and i make more console.logs and other factors to it, I make the story a little more entertaining i move around things to some what feel more easy for me. I kept this theme because I wanted to express myself. I wanted to see if I could keep expanding my story to fit the criteria of the assignment every week. </p>
